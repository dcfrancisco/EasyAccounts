//=======================================
A.D 20-10-2002 The 20th of great October, 2 years next the eventful millenium.

** Things to Remember:
Removed special privileges COMPANY.ADM and ONQ.CMP to allow closure of
individual companies. Combined this right into ICLOSE.EA

(If the COMPANY is Administration, then it will automatically close all
 the companies. So that issue goes to rest. But still, it needs ICLOSE.EA
 to activate the Closure.)

Removed all the privileges of ONQ.CMP regarding one company system.
From now on, EasyAccounts will always run on multiple company configuration.

** Things to Note:
Changed .NTX into .CDX (DBFNTX to not DBFCDX, but Comix!)
Therefore we have faster queries, filters and indexing and a more
powerful and flexible recordlist capability (ClipMore!)

Therefore, (**IMPORTANT**) the starting byte of BOOKSTAT.DBF is not either
chr(03) (which is to be used for normal databases) or chr(131)(memo database)
but chr(245) (õ) for the memo database BOOKSTAT. (For normal dbfs, the old
chr(03) still prevails.) And not BOOKSTAT.DBT but BOOKSTAT.FPT
                         (ie,take foxpro.exe with the EA disk)

For the above, I have rewritten the PROT.EXE to check for .FPT or BOOKSTAT.DBF
and apply the Foxpro letter (õ) to it. For normal .DBTs, it would add the
Clipper letter (ƒ). So no great need to worry about PROT. But one thing
remains, take the SETBOOK.PRG with the EA Disk, which is necessery to convert
Clipper DBF DBT to Foxpro FPT (ie, to create an FPT file for BOOKSTAT)

New PBREAK.EXE - to give the Answer Key for the registration code of EA.
New PSET.EXE   - to create USERS.DBF with SUP password in the current
