ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

History: (19-Mar-2004)

  This project started as a fancy to me, just to move away from the
  mundane programming practices I was following (when I was 13).

  Till then, I've been using the core of my father's application
  and just tweaked them to fit the requirements of my newer clients.
  That code was a mess of public and private variables, was very
  much unstructured and was very very difficult to maintain.

  So, when the work of A.M Hospital came up, I decided not to use any
  of the existing application frameworks and built one from scratch.
  And that work can be said to be my first real work, the one I developed
  ALL by myself. But this work too had the lingering of the old projects,
  not in the code, but in the database structure, certain programming
  and user interface logics etc. Only the code was entirely new. My
  vision of a user interface and the menu and even most of the screen
  colors were the same as that of my existing projects.

  It was then I felt a little adventerous and started to think seriously
  about the disadvantages of the existing database structures. By then,
  I was exposed to many good accounting packages and had grasped the
  code-less accounting paradigm and also many intutive user interface
  methods. A white status bar on the top and bottom of the screen was
  something which I craved for. I developed a liking to keep a constant
  U.I and screen appearance feel in all parts of the program. But since
  all my existing projects (even including A.M), was not based on any
  such organisation, I made that historical (for me..) decision that
  I wanted something better. And I went for it.

  And EasyAccounts was born. To be exact, the very preliminary modules
  (the Item Master and Accounts master) where somewhat ready on 30th
  August 2001 (30-08-2001). The first running version of the
  software (ver 1.0) was ready on 9th September 2001 (09-09-2001).
  (look at d:\jasim\clworks\ea_revs\old\rev2)

  September 2001 had me in the 9th standard at Sree Buddha, and the
  work has now carried the software to its 4.1 PRO version which now
  (as on the date of this writing - 19th Mar 2004) finds me waiting
  for the next 2 exams of the Plus One course.

  Please see the sparsely documented evolution cycle of EasyAccounts
  spanning about 3 years..


What's New?
  Lots! Listed below 20 major revisions in EasyAccounts
  making it much much better, easier and friendlier!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  i)  User Interface - Now the Index Files and most reports includes
      progress bars for better user feedback.

 ii)  Better Software Security - EasyAccounts has been armed with
      award winning security system. The chances of its piration
      has been made almost nil!

iii)  Screen Management - EasyAccounts is now supplied with 66
      EGA/VGA fonts enabling the user to adjust the screen
      according to his/her whims and fancies! (Shortcut key F6)

 iv)  Colour Management - An Additional Colour (Yellow) has been
      included in the VGA colour redefinition (RGB) panel
      for better colour adjustment.

  v)  Seperate Dr. Cr. Column has been added in the daily sheet removing
      the daybook entries from the SALES/PURCHASE heading making an
      easier view possible.

 vi)  Trial Balance - A very easily comprehendable Trial Balance has been
      added to the existing accounting system seamlessly integrating the
      debit and credit tally criteria into the Income/Expense based data
      entry system.

vii)  Change in Menu Appearances - The appearance of the menu has been
      slightly modified by introducing seperation lines in between menus
      of different types.

viii) Company Management - The EA user has been awarded more power and
      flexibility with the introduction of the ability to create
      unlimited number of companies with customizations.

 ix)  Safer and Better Backup - The Backup module now saves additional
      company and directory information to make data recovery more
      safe and sound in the case of an emergency.

  x)  Telephone Directory - An Alphabetically grouped telephone directory
      (printable) has been added. Searching and printing telephone numbers
      is now faster and easier.

 xi)  Perfected Dues Report - The bugs in dues report has been removed
      and is now accurate.

xii)  Protected Mode - Now EasyAccounts works in Protected Mode (Extended)
      which enables it to break the 16 MB EMS and 640k conventional memory
      barriers.

xiii) Compressed and Encrypted - The EasyAccounts executable is compressed
      and encrypted with a powerful tool which makes it more compact and
      hacker resistant!

xiv)  More Portable - The SET CLIPPER environment variable is now burned
      into the EasyAccounts executable so that it can be easily ported
      without much fuss.

 xv)  F4 DOS Prompt - Now you can access DOS prompt from anywhere in the
      program so as to edit and copy reports etc. (Key F4)

xvi)  Faster Indexing - Indexing of databases (Reindex Files) is now better
      optimized yielding a faster operation. 

xvii) Batch System - An almost transparent batch processing now takes place
      to provide with accurate inventory information and control.
             - New hotkey F11 to know the batch info. of the selected item
               from anywhere in the program. ( An item should be active )
             - Completely automated batch processing. When a new batch is
               added, it is informed to the user during Purchase.
               No batch selection is to be made by the user during Sales as
               EasyAccounts automatically selects one or more appropriate
               Batches.

Related Changes ==> i) Now COST of items cannot be changed unless a purchase
                       is made.
                   ii) The COST field in the 'Add Item' or 'Edit Item',
                       invoked from the 'Add/Edit Master Items' browse window,
                       has been changed into 'Op.Cost' which is actually the
                       cost of the Op.Stock.
                  iii) The Cost Report now gives the actual Cost of each batch
                       and therefore a correct estimation of Total Cost can be
                       made.
                   iv) The Item Report now contains a new Sub Title named
                       'Batch Details' which lists each Batch and its
                       corresponding balance stock.
                    v) To prevent overcrowding of unused Batches, a garbage
                       collection facility has been added to 'Reindex Files'
                       which on operation, clears off the unused Batches.
       [IMPORTANT] vi) Now a Purchase which was already made cannot be
                       deleted if the stock has already been sold. Clearly,
                       there SHOULD be enough balance stock available to
                       delete a purchase and thus prevent Negative Balance.

xviii) In sales, the entry of Negative Stock has been disabled. From now on, 
       the cursor will not move if there is no balance stock. It just displays
       a message and will go back to the 'Add Item' prompt.

  xix) Multiple Company Catalog Capability - Now other than using all companies
       from a single EasyAccounts window, you can create multiple company
       groups in which the 'Select Company' dialog would be different for
       different PATHs (Shortcuts) from which EA is called. You can have
       a set of WSS companies in one window and set of ESTIMATE companies
       in another window (window means Shortcut in the Windows Desktop)

   xx) Last but not the Least! - Public Account facility. Now, you can group
       accounts from 'different' companies together and get 'Great' reports.
       For example, if you want to know all the Bank Transactions ever made
       in a single company catalog, then what you have to do is get the
       Public Accounts menu, call each and every company, add its bank a/cs
       to the same public account and then call its Ledger. Once created and
       linked, the A/Cs remain so unless did otherwise. So whenever you want
       to get a Detailed/Summary, by Date/Account, with Daily Balance/without
       it or whatever maybe, you can simply get it with a few strokes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Great, is'nt it? Now you have a much improved EasyAccounts before you. It has
been made twice efficient and productive. Taking into consideration the great
efforts put forward for acheiving this breakthrough, an advancement in the
version of EasyAccounts has been made.

EasyAccounts v2.1 PRO has been revised to EasyAccounts v2.5 PRO. Hope you
benefit greatly from this brand new, breakthrough software.

Wishing you many many Easy Accounting days ahead,
The EA Developers.

WhatsNew as On 20th Jan. 2003

  i) DirectGo Reports full fledged - There is now a top-to-bottom drill
     down facility in almost all the reports. From the List A/C Balances,
     press the enter key and the ledger for the highlighted party comes up.
     From the ledger again, press enter to get the details of that particular
     entry - be it Cashbook, Bankbook, Daybook or Sales & Purchase!

 ii) Organized SETUP and INSTALL (Company creation) for better performance.
     Now, BOOKSTAT.DBF is not packed up with the installation file (INSTALL.DAT)
     It is DBCREATEd everytime INSTALL creates a new company. ('Cauz, I dont
     want to link COMIX with SETUP due to which it can't create the
     .FPT BOOKSTAT files which is used by EA. If it isnt .FPT structure,
     then COMIX pops out a corruption detected error.

The year 2003 has been quite eventful, except in the case of the
development cycle of EasyAccounts. Being engaged in many other activities,
(especially my Std.X CBSE board exam), I fear EasyAccounts had to be moved
to the backyard of my active occupations.

But January 2004 has seen me profusely working at EA and have proved very
benefecial to the entire package.

So, here is the:
==-------------------------==
WhatsNew as On 23rd Jan. 2004
==-------------------------==

  i) Integrated Service Call Register and corresponding Accounts modules
     making EasyAccounts the perfect all-in-one software for the
     Computer Sales & Service industry.

 ii) Account Grouping with reports based on Entire Groups or Sub-Groups.
     A Great addition to the host of useful features of EasyAccounts.

iii) A Drill-down Balance Sheet incorporated to EA, making it a really easy
     but world-class accounting solution.

 iv) Accounting Reports (including Balance Sheet, Trial Balance and List A/C
     balances) re-coded for allowing period-wise reports
     (from the starting of the financial year till the selected date).

  v) EA Network Support enhanced to allow Server-Client security interaction.
     The Server needs to be registered for the clients (which also have to
     be registered) to interact with it and successfully run on a network
     environment.
